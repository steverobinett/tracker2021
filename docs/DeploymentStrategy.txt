NOTES:
    1. We will deploy our code to the server using FTP, not by using the file manager.
    2. The default permissions on the files should not interfere with anything we need to do.
    3. The day after every sprint we should deploy the code to the server.
Plan for deploying code to Server
    1. Merge current sprint branch into main branch. {GIT}
    2. Do a pull on main to make sure you have the latest version.
    3. Use the push ftp account to upload files.
        a. Host Name: ftp.stevenrobinett.com
        b.  Port: 21
        c.  User: push@stevenrobinett.com
        d. Password: csci2021PUSH!
    4. The destination dir is “public_html/dev”
    5. When you connect using the push ftp account you should be sitting in the directory stated above.
    6. Drag and drop the landing page, all root level documents and sub-folders from the main git branch into this directory. { public_html/dev}
